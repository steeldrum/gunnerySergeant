This blog topic is titled "<strong>Where is it?</strong>".  We agree that every gun owner should always have an answer to this question whenever it is posed.  Members of our site, on occasion, are contacted with their GS (Gunnery Sergeant).  If this question is posed, will they always have a ready answer?
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will reinforce the appropriateness and importance of this simple question.  Furthermore, while doing this, the reader should be able to understand  how our web site could be useful in preventing tragedies.
</p>
<p>
News report: "<strong>Nursing home resident shoots, kills self</strong>" (dated August 31, 2016 B1 <i>Boston Globe</i>).  During the investigation a police captain remarked: "One of the big questions is, what's a gun doing in a nursing home?" (<i>remarking on the fact that the nursing home bans guns on the property</i>).
</p>
<p>
Could this tragic event been avoided?  We cannot guarantee avoiding every gun-related tragedy.  However we hope and believe that our "groundswell managed militia" approach can mitigate or minimize incidents such as the one headlined.  To see why read on.
</p>
<p>
Our members consists primarily of gun owners (we call them <i>privates</i>).  These modern day militia members are periodically contacted by someone who never really knows their name (salutations are handled by so-called 'handles' - see FAQs for more detail).  The contact initiator is possibly another gun owner (or not).  Since the initiator contacts the actual gun owner we call the initiator role a "Gunnery Sergeant" (aka GS or <i>sergeant</i>) role.  It is important to note that a third-party role exists.  Every private member (gun owner) has a <i>sponsor</i>.  The GS knows nothing about this sponsor.  The sponsor knows, is related to, or is somehow acquainted with the private gun owner (e.g. a close friend).  A final element in this equation is this: <i>time</i>.  Over time a GS is expected to contact members in his or her 'platoon of privates'.  You now have enough details to speculate on how the above event may have been avoided.  Let's give it a try!
</p>
<p>
An elderly man gets admitted to a nursing home.  None of us know all the details but it should't matter.  We will postulate some details as scenarios and see what happens.
</p>
<p>
Scenario one.  He owns a gun and is a private member.  The GS tries to contact him but he has 'moved' and can't be reached (in this case he was signed in the nursing home by someone such as his wife or a child, etc.).  Although the GS knows nothing about the private (save his or her handle) the GS can "trigger" a message to the private's sponsor such as this:  "Dear sponsor of &lt;handle&gt;, I have not been able to reach &lt;handle&gt;.  Just checking in.  Please let us know if anything has changed."
</p>
<p>
A responsible sponsor (e.g. this fellow's wife) could reply that he has been placed into a nursing home facility.  This obviously establishes a dialog outside of the private's ken.
The ensuing dialog, we have to presume, would include the fundamental question posed in this post: "Where is it?" (i.e. the gun).  The scenario can diverge in several ways such as 'oops - I don't see it where he usually keeps it!', 'oops - he must have packed it and taken it with him.  I'll inform the nursing home!'.
</p>
<p>
There are too many possibilities to list them all.  There's even more scenarios such as Scenario two.  A son owns the gun and is the registered private.  In that case the GS may have contacted the son and asked the proverbial question.  This may result in the son being alerted that the gun is missing.  Could dad have taken it?  Why?
</p>
<p>
The reader should now be able to understand the positive impact of our "groundswell managed militia" approach.  Over a period of weeks or months (the time factor) some hiccup could be noticed by a vigilant sergeant.  If a simple question such as "where is it?" can't be satisfactorily answered, that dilemma is likely to trigger some research resulting in preventative action (such as returning the gun from a nursing home).
</p>
<p>
In this tragic case, the gun owner was not a private.  There was no sergeant to check in occasionally.  We'd like to assume there were loved ones however (the sponsor role). A sponsor might have thought through ramifications of the "where is it?" question and prevented the event (even without the prompting of a sergeant's query).  A sponsor might have noticed depression settling in over time.  With suitable prompting via regular contact maybe, we think, this suicidal spiral:
</p>
<p>
"And all you have to do
<br/>
Is move your little finger,
<br/>
Move your little finger and-
<br/>
You can change the world."
</p>
<p>
<strong>wouldn't have occurred!</strong>

  AP news release - mid March 2016.  "...Florida woman whose 4-year-old son accidentally shot her in the back..." and more detail a few days later (via AP): 
 "The mother...put a loaded .45 caliber handgun underneath the front seat of her pickup...and the weapon slid into the back seat..." continuing "The boy got out of his seat and picked up the gun.  He fired through the front seat, hitting his mother in the back.  The bullet exited through her chest and through the windshield."

<p>
This blog topic is titled "<strong>Is it secure?</strong>".  Members of our site, on occasion, are contacted with their GS (Gunnery Sergeant).  If this question is posed, will they always have a ready answer?
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will reinforce the appropriateness and importance of this simple question. But first, what about this comment? "My right to protect my child with my gun trumps your fear of my gun" - source anonymous.
</p>
<p>
Before discussing the motivating AP news release, let's talk about "My right to protect my child with my gun...".  In other words lets talk about the <i>law</i>.  The same press release leads us to believe this woman is aware of some laws but ignores others.  Lets start with what she knows:
</p>
<p>It's clear she knows the rights spelled out in the Second Amendment:  "...the right of the people to keep and bear Arms...".  Unfortunately there exists other propositions, other laws that she either didn't know about or forgot.  What follows are examples of relevant theories and facts.
</p>
<p>
According to Swiss
 psychologist <a style="margin-top: 10px;" class="w3-btn w3-round-large" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget">Jean Piaget</a> (1896-1980) a child's Concrete Operational Stage occurs between the ages of 7
 and 11, and [this stage] illustrates logical thought processes.  
</p>
<p>"Just a single little finger
<br/>
Can change the world."
<br/>
- Stephan Sondheim (from The Gun Song - see "Where is it?" post)
</p>
<p>A four year old child is simply too young to understand the full consequences when handling a gun.  But, we admit, this is just theory.  Next let's discuss <i>law</i></p>
<p>There happens to be a law about guns that every member of Congress is in complete agreement!  It will never be abrogated, infringed or otherwise changed!  That's nice to know isn't it?  Agreement at last (regarding at least one aspect of "gun control")!
</p>
<p>
The law is of course:  <i>The tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what Galileo called inertia. This insight was refined by Newton, who made it into his first law, also known as the "law of inertia"</i>.
Source: <a href= " https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">Wikipedia</a>
</p>
<p>
This "law" of physics known for centuries is what caused this: "the weapon slid into the back seat" (quote from above AP release).  The fundemental question of this blog, "is it secure?" The answer, sadly, in this specific instance was clearly no!
</p>
<p>
The explanation is that a metal gun, for example, is a lot heavier than a toy plastic gun.  When a truck is quickly accelerated, the heavier object (e.g. the .45 caliber handgun) resists moving with the truck.  Hence it "slides" backwards.
</p>
<p>
In this case the gun wasn't physically 'secure'.  Based on other recent news reports such as this: "<strong>Accidental shooting leaves boy badly hurt</strong>" (<i>Boston Globe Sept. 1st, 2016</i>) we need to broaden the definition of the word 'secure'.  The prior case was clearly one related to the physical security of the gun.  This headline, or many like it, are the result of clear negligence of adults not ensuring a gun is secured (out of reach by children).  An 11 year old boy was shot in the face while visiting a friend.  The answer to our question: "Is it secure?" Sadly, again was no!

<p>
This blog topic is titled "<strong>Is it registered?</strong>".  Members of our site, on occasion, are contacted with their GS (Gunnery Sergeant).  If this question is posed, they should always say no!
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will reinforce the appropriateness and importance of this simple question (even though the answer will <i>always</i> be no).
</p>
<p>
Many citizens assume that a properly owned firearm can and should be registered.  A car can kill or injure and is required to be registered.  Indeed insured as well so that damages can be paid to whomever is injured (or killed).  Not so with guns.
</p>
<p>
The more proper phrasing of the question on hand is perhaps this: "Is it permitted?" (i.e. has the gun owner filled out a form such as an FA-10 permit).  Gun permits simply track transactions that are legal.  In a special report (<i>North Shore Sunday</i> March 18, 2016 written by Al Gentile) headlined: "<strong>State tracks gun sales, not owners</strong>" Mr. Gentile describes any database as strictly transactional.  The article points out that it is useless to go in and say, "This is who owns this firearm right now."
</p>
<p>
So let's get back to the question and the easy answer: <strong>NO!</strong>  There is (and evidently <i>never</i> will be) a registration database for firearms that is as robust as, for example, automobiles or trucks.  From Mr Gentile's article we have this quote:
</p>
<p>
"Quite frankly, the entire system is a mess," said Jim Wallace, executive director of the Gun Owners Action League.  "The system is designed to register and watch good guys, but not designed to watch bad guys."
</p>
<p>
Later on Mr Gentile's article has another quote of interest.  An excerpt from the article:
</p>
<div class="w3-grey">
<p>
Lars Dalseide, the media manager for the National Rifle Association, stated such a system would be ineffective regardless.
</p>
<p>
"What is the purpose of a gun registry if criminals aren't going to register their guns in the first place?  Law-abiding gun owners aren't (by definition) going to break the law and will report any thefts to the authorities.  Unless the state hopes to use that list as guidelines for enforcing future bans or confiscation, there is no valid reason," Dalseide stated.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Pay special attention towards the end of Mr. Dalseide's remarks: "...use that list as guidelines for enforcing future bans or confiscation..."  The greatest fear held by gun rights advocates is the establishment of some central "database" of all gun owners.  Why?  because it would include law-abiding owners and (hopefully) crooks.  The former group lives in fear that in some future time, perhaps in a crisis or sorts, the so-called 'list' could be used to actually <i>remove</i> firearms!  This may, or may not be a well-founded fear.  However it looms <strong>VERY</strong> big and any mention of a database (especially a Federal one) will be forever fought tooth and nail.  That explains why the answer to this blog's question will always be no.
</p>
<p>
Does that mean the question should never be asked?  Should there be some form of registration?  This web site provides a suitable answer to the latter question.  Understanding this web site should settle any qualms about a scary "list" whose potential is to take away firearms.  The Second Amendment is never threatened.  Owners still have the right to "keep and bear Arms."
</p>
<p>
So how does this site manage to corral bad guys (you know - the ones with guns without permits)?  The mechanism is somewhat described by taking a tour through the site's FAQs.  However we summarize it here:
</p>
<p>
In effect we substitute this post's fundamental question: "Is it registered?" with a more benign and discreet question: "Who is your gunnery sergeant?"  The "groundswell managed militia" approach depends on each and every concerned person to accept our approach:  "We Do Our Part".  By asking this question to anyone who has a gun (permitted or not) the response is very telling.
We invented a very discreet "handle" that identifies all enlisted members (we call them enlistees not registrants).  The gun owner is assigned a sergeant who also has a handle.  Some 'privates' (as we call them - but they're really gun owners) never are listed in any database we have.  The only identification we have is their handle (and zip code).  Such a list could never be used to confiscate anyones guns!
Their are protective mechanisms in place, such as maintaining information on a private's sponsor.  This leads to a very credible (though private and discreet) tracking system.  We admit somewhat complex until thought out and understood...
