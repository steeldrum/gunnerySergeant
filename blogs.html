"And all you have to do

Move your little finger and-

You can change the world.

What a wonder is a gun!

What a versatile invention!

First of all, when you've a gun-

Everybody pays attention.

GunnerySergeant.org welcomes topic suggestions for our blog.  Simply email your ideas to gunnerysergeant@collogistics.com.  Remember - we depend on you as our adopted motto is "We Do Our Part".  This means your submitted ideas imply that you're doing your part to help with our "groundswell regulated militia"!

<p>
This blog topic is titled "<strong>Where is it?</strong>".  We agree that every gun owner should always have an answer to this question whenever it is posed.  Members of our site, on occasion, are contacted with their GS (Gunnery Sergeant).  If this question is posed, will they always have a ready answer?
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will reinforce the appropriateness and importance of this simple question.  Furthermore, while doing this, the reader should be able to understand  how our web site could be useful in preventing tragedies.
</p>
<p>
News report: "<strong>Nursing home resident shoots, kills self</strong>" (dated August 31, 2016 B1 <i>Boston Globe</i>).  During the investigation a police captain remarked: "One of the big questions is, what's a gun doing in a nursing home?" (<i>remarking on the fact that the nursing home bans guns on the property</i>).
</p>
<p>
Could this tragic event been avoided?  We cannot guarantee avoiding every gun-related tragedy.  However we hope and believe that our "groundswell managed militia" approach can mitigate or minimize incidents such as the one headlined.  To see why read on.
</p>
<p>
Our members consists primarily of gun owners (we call them <i>privates</i>).  These modern day militia members are periodically contacted by someone who never really knows their name (salutations are handled by so-called 'handles' - see FAQs for more detail).  The contact initiator is possibly another gun owner (or not).  Since the initiator contacts the actual gun owner we call the initiator role a "Gunnery Sergeant" (aka GS or <i>sergeant</i>) role.  It is important to note that a third-party role exists.  Every private member (gun owner) has a <i>sponsor</i>.  The GS knows nothing about this sponsor.  The sponsor knows, is related to, or is somehow acquainted with the private gun owner (e.g. a close friend).  A final element in this equation is this: <i>time</i>.  Over time a GS is expected to contact members in his or her 'platoon of privates'.  You now have enough details to speculate on how the above event may have been avoided.  Let's give it a try!
</p>
<p>
An elderly man gets admitted to a nursing home.  None of us know all the details but it should't matter.  We will postulate some details as scenarios and see what happens.
</p>
<p>
Scenario one.  He owns a gun and is a private member.  The GS tries to contact him but he has 'moved' and can't be reached (in this case he was signed in the nursing home by someone such as his wife or a child, etc.).  Although the GS knows nothing about the private (save his or her handle) the GS can "trigger" a message to the private's sponsor such as this:  "Dear sponsor of &lt;handle&gt;, I have not been able to reach &lt;handle&gt;.  Just checking in.  Please let us know if anything has changed."
</p>
<p>
A responsible sponsor (e.g. this fellow's wife) could reply that he has been placed into a nursing home facility.  This obviously establishes a dialog outside of the private's ken.
The ensuing dialog, we have to presume, would include the fundamental question posed in this post: "Where is it?" (i.e. the gun).  The scenario can diverge in several ways such as 'oops - I don't see it where he usually keeps it!', 'oops - he must have packed it and taken it with him.  I'll inform the nursing home!'.
</p>
<p>
There are too many possibilities to list them all.  There's even more scenarios such as Scenario two.  A son owns the gun and is the registered private.  In that case the GS may have contacted the son and asked the proverbial question.  This may result in the son being alerted that the gun is missing.  Could dad have taken it?  Why?
</p>
<p>
The reader should now be able to understand the positive impact of our "groundswell managed militia" approach.  Over a period of weeks or months (the time factor) some hiccup could be noticed by a vigilant sergeant.  If a simple question such as "where is it?" can't be satisfactorily answered, that dilemma is likely to trigger some research resulting in preventative action (such as returning the gun from a nursing home).
</p>
<p>
In this tragic case, the gun owner was not a private.  There was no sergeant to check in occasionally.  We'd like to assume there were loved ones however (the sponsor role). A sponsor might have thought through ramifications of the "where is it?" question and prevented the event (even without the prompting of a sergeant's query).  A sponsor might have noticed depression settling in over time.  With suitable prompting via regular contact maybe, we think, this suicidal spiral:

"And all you have to do
<br/>
Is move your little finger,
<br/>
Move your little finger and-
<br/>
You can change the world."
