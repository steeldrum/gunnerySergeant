This blog topic is titled "<strong>Where is it?</strong>".  We agree that every gun owner should always have an answer to this question whenever it is posed.  Members of our site, on occasion, are contacted with their GS (Gunnery Sergeant).  If this question is posed, will they always have a ready answer?
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will reinforce the appropriateness and importance of this simple question.  Furthermore, while doing this, the reader should be able to understand  how our web site could be useful in preventing tragedies.
</p>
<p>
News report: "<strong>Nursing home resident shoots, kills self</strong>" (dated August 31, 2016 B1 <i>Boston Globe</i>).  During the investigation a police captain remarked: "One of the big questions is, what's a gun doing in a nursing home?" (<i>remarking on the fact that the nursing home bans guns on the property</i>).
</p>
<p>
Could this tragic event been avoided?  We cannot guarantee avoiding every gun-related tragedy.  However we hope and believe that our "groundswell managed militia" approach can mitigate or minimize incidents such as the one headlined.  To see why read on.
</p>
<p>
Our members consists primarily of gun owners (we call them <i>privates</i>).  These modern day militia members are periodically contacted by someone who never really knows their name (salutations are handled by so-called 'handles' - see FAQs for more detail).  The contact initiator is possibly another gun owner (or not).  Since the initiator contacts the actual gun owner we call the initiator role a "Gunnery Sergeant" (aka GS or <i>sergeant</i>) role.  It is important to note that a third-party role exists.  Every private member (gun owner) has a <i>sponsor</i>.  The GS knows nothing about this sponsor.  The sponsor knows, is related to, or is somehow acquainted with the private gun owner (e.g. a close friend).  A final element in this equation is this: <i>time</i>.  Over time a GS is expected to contact members in his or her 'platoon of privates'.  You now have enough details to speculate on how the above event may have been avoided.  Let's give it a try!
</p>
<p>
An elderly man gets admitted to a nursing home.  None of us know all the details but it should't matter.  We will postulate some details as scenarios and see what happens.
</p>
<p>
Scenario one.  He owns a gun and is a private member.  The GS tries to contact him but he has 'moved' and can't be reached (in this case he was signed in the nursing home by someone such as his wife or a child, etc.).  Although the GS knows nothing about the private (save his or her handle) the GS can "trigger" a message to the private's sponsor such as this:  "Dear sponsor of &lt;handle&gt;, I have not been able to reach &lt;handle&gt;.  Just checking in.  Please let us know if anything has changed."
</p>
<p>
A responsible sponsor (e.g. this fellow's wife) could reply that he has been placed into a nursing home facility.  This obviously establishes a dialog outside of the private's ken.
The ensuing dialog, we have to presume, would include the fundamental question posed in this post: "Where is it?" (i.e. the gun).  The scenario can diverge in several ways such as 'oops - I don't see it where he usually keeps it!', 'oops - he must have packed it and taken it with him.  I'll inform the nursing home!'.
</p>
<p>
There are too many possibilities to list them all.  There's even more scenarios such as Scenario two.  A son owns the gun and is the registered private.  In that case the GS may have contacted the son and asked the proverbial question.  This may result in the son being alerted that the gun is missing.  Could dad have taken it?  Why?
</p>
<p>
The reader should now be able to understand the positive impact of our "groundswell managed militia" approach.  Over a period of weeks or months (the time factor) some hiccup could be noticed by a vigilant sergeant.  If a simple question such as "where is it?" can't be satisfactorily answered, that dilemma is likely to trigger some research resulting in preventative action (such as returning the gun from a nursing home).
</p>
<p>
In this tragic case, the gun owner was not a private.  There was no sergeant to check in occasionally.  We'd like to assume there were loved ones however (the sponsor role). A sponsor might have thought through ramifications of the "where is it?" question and prevented the event (even without the prompting of a sergeant's query).  A sponsor might have noticed depression settling in over time.  With suitable prompting via regular contact maybe, we think, this suicidal spiral:
</p>
<p>
"And all you have to do
<br/>
Is move your little finger,
<br/>
Move your little finger and-
<br/>
You can change the world."
</p>
<p>
<strong>wouldn't have occurred!</strong>

  AP news release - mid March 2016.  "...Florida woman whose 4-year-old son accidentally shot her in the back..." and more detail a few days later (via AP): 
 "The mother...put a loaded .45 caliber handgun underneath the front seat of her pickup...and the weapon slid into the back seat..." continuing "The boy got out of his seat and picked up the gun.

<p>
This blog topic is titled "<strong>Is it secure?</strong>".  Members of our site, on occasion, are contacted with their GS (Gunnery Sergeant).  If this question is posed, will they always have a ready answer?
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will reinforce the appropriateness and importance of this simple question. But first, what about this comment? "My right to protect my child with my gun trumps your fear of my gun" - source anonymous.
</p>
<p>
Before discussing the motivating AP news release, let's talk about "My right to protect my child with my gun...".  In other words lets talk about the <i>law</i>.  The same press release leads us to believe this woman is aware of some laws but ignores others.  Lets start with what she knows:
</p>
<p>It's clear she knows the rights spelled out in the Second Amendment:  "...the right of the people to keep and bear Arms...".  Unfortunately there exists other propositions, other laws that she either didn't know about or forgot.  What follows are examples of relevant theories and facts.
</p>
<p>
According to Swiss
 psychologist <a style="margin-top: 10px;" class="w3-btn w3-round-large" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget">Jean Piaget</a> (1896-1980) a child's Concrete Operational Stage occurs between the ages of 7
 and 11, and [this stage] illustrates logical thought processes.  
</p>
<p>"Just a single little finger
<br/>
Can change the world."
<br/>
- Stephan Sondheim (from The Gun Song - see "Where is it?" post)
</p>
<p>A four year old child is simply too young to understand the full consequences when handling a gun.  But, we admit, this is just theory.  Next let's discuss <i>law</i></p>
<p>There happens to be a law about guns that every member of Congress is in complete agreement!  It will never be abrogated, infringed or otherwise changed!  That's nice to know isn't it?  Agreement at last (regarding at least one aspect of "gun control")!
</p>
<p>
The law is of course:  <i>The tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what Galileo called inertia. This insight was refined by Newton, who made it into his first law, also known as the "law of inertia"</i>.
Source: <a href= " https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">Wikipedia</a>
</p>
<p>
This "law" of physics known for centuries is what caused this: "the weapon slid into the back seat" (quote from above AP release).  The fundemental question of this blog, "is it secure?" The answer, sadly, in this specific instance was clearly no!
</p>
<p>
The explanation is that a metal gun, for example, is a lot heavier than a toy plastic gun.  When a truck is quickly accelerated, the heavier object (e.g. the .45 caliber handgun) resists moving with the truck.  Hence it "slides" backwards.
</p>
<p>
In this case the gun wasn't physically 'secure'.  Based on other recent news reports such as this: "<strong>Accidental shooting leaves boy badly hurt</strong>" (<i>Boston Globe Sept. 1st, 2016</i>) we need to broaden the definition of the word 'secure'.  The prior case was clearly one related to the physical security of the gun.  This headline, or many like it, are the result of clear negligence of adults not ensuring a gun is secured (out of reach by children).  An 11 year old boy was shot in the face while visiting a friend.  The answer to our question: "Is it secure?" Sadly, again was no!

  <div id="Demob3" class="w3-accordion-content w3-container w3-sand">
<p>
This blog topic is titled "<strong>Is it registered?</strong>".  Members of our site, on occasion, are contacted with their GS (Gunnery Sergeant).  If this question is posed, they should always say yes and no!
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will reinforce the appropriateness and importance of this simple question (even though the answer will <i>always</i> be both yes and no).
</p>
<p>
Many citizens assume that a properly owned firearm can and should be registered.  A car can kill or injure and is required to be registered.  Indeed insured as well so that damages can be paid to whomever is injured (or killed).  There is no registration database for guns.
</p>
<p>
The more proper phrasing of the question on hand is perhaps this: "Is it permitted?" (i.e. has the gun owner filled out a form such as an FA-10 permit).  Gun permits simply track transactions that are legal.  In a special report (<i>North Shore Sunday</i> March 18, 2016 written by Al Gentile) headlined: "<strong>State tracks gun sales, not owners</strong>" Mr. Gentile describes any database as strictly transactional.  The article points out that it is useless to go in and say, "This is who owns this firearm right now."
</p>
<p>
So let's get back to the question and the not so easy answer: <strong>YES AND NO!</strong>  There is (and evidently <i>never</i> will be) a registration database for firearms that is as robust as, for example, automobiles or trucks.  From Mr Gentile's article we have this quote:
</p>
<p>
"Quite frankly, the entire system is a mess," said Jim Wallace, executive director of the Gun Owners Action League.  "The system is designed to register and watch good guys, but not designed to watch bad guys."
</p>
<p>
Later on Mr Gentile's article has another quote of interest.  An excerpt from the article:
</p>
<div class="w3-grey">
<p>
Lars Dalseide, the media manager for the National Rifle Association, stated such a system would be ineffective regardless.
</p>
<p>
"What is the purpose of a gun registry if criminals aren't going to register their guns in the first place?  Law-abiding gun owners aren't (by definition) going to break the law and will report any thefts to the authorities.  Unless the state hopes to use that list as guidelines for enforcing future bans or confiscation, there is no valid reason," Dalseide stated.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Pay special attention towards the end of Mr. Dalseide's remarks: "...use that list as guidelines for enforcing future bans or confiscation..."  The greatest fear held by gun rights advocates is the establishment of some central "database" of all gun owners.  Why?  because it would include law-abiding owners as well as (hopefully) crooks.  The former group lives in fear that in some future time, perhaps in a crisis or sorts, the so-called 'list' could be used to actually <i>remove</i> firearms!  This may, or may not be a well-founded fear.  However it looms <strong>VERY</strong> big and any mention of a database (especially a Federal one) will be forever fought tooth and nail.  That explains why one answer to this blog's question will always be no.
</p>
<p>
Does that mean the question should never be asked?  Should there be some form of registration?  This web site provides a suitable answer to the latter question, implying a possible <i>yes</i>.  Understanding this web site should settle any qualms about a scary "list" whose potential is to take away firearms.  The Second Amendment is never threatened.  Owners still have the right to "keep and bear Arms."
</p>
<p>
So how does this site manage to corral bad guys (you know - the ones with guns without permits)?  The mechanism is somewhat described by taking a tour through the site's FAQs.  However we summarize it here:
</p>
<p>
In effect we substitute this post's fundamental question: "Is it registered?" with a more benign and discreet question: "Who is your gunnery sergeant?"  The "groundswell managed militia" approach depends on each and every concerned person to accept our approach:  "We Do Our Part".  By asking this question to anyone who has a gun (permitted or not) the response is very telling.
We invented a very discreet "handle" that identifies all enlisted members (we call them enlistees not registrants).  The gun owner is assigned a sergeant who also has a handle.  Some 'privates' (as we call them - but they're really gun owners) never have their personal information (e.g. first and last name, address, etc.) listed in any database we have.  The only identification we have is their handle (and zip code) and their gun specifics.  Such a list could never be used to confiscate anyones guns!  Why?  The list (i.e. database) has the <i>what</i> (gun information) but not necessarily the <i>who</i> (gun owner information).
There are protective mechanisms in place, such as maintaining information on a private's sponsor.  This leads to a very credible (though private and discreet) tracking system.  We admit somewhat complex until thought out and understood...
</p>
<p>
So why do we use this approach and how will it help identify malcontent gun owners?  There are several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The site doesn't "culture-bundle" (as defined by Ken White - OP ED via Tribune Content Agency, LLC Dec. 16th, 2015).  What is that, you say?  Mr White says: "Our unproductive talk about guns is rife with this.  Gun control advocate don't just attack support for guns; they attack conservative, Republican, rural and religious values."
He gos on: "Second Amendment advocates don't just attack gun control advocates; they attack liberal, Democratic, urban and secular values."  Our site, a "groundswell managed militia" cannot threaten KABA rights (Keep And Bear Arms) if we don't necessarily know who owns them!  We are apolitical and therefore acceptable to gun rights advocates and we represent a plausible solution to gun control advocates that doesn't require overcoming the hurdle of contentious legislation.
</li>
<li>Being apolitical the site doesn't take a formal position on the topic of "gun control".  Mr White points out folks who, for example, push for a ban of "semiautomatic weapons", use improper terminology. He says theses weapons: "actually refer to nearly every modern day weapons other than bolt-action rifles and shotguns."  Instead we have a clever mechanism to track guns (outside of any weak gun-permit system).  The FAQs help explain this as do our parlor presentations as cited in another web site <a href="NRA.rip">(NRA.rip)</a>.  Our strength depends on a groundswell movement where everyone knows this: "We Do Our Part."
</li>
<li>We do not insult the KABA rights folks.  We understand that they are as passionate as, for example, speech rights advocates.  (Mr. White's third point).  Indeed, we hope and expect Dalseide's "law-abiding" gun owners will regularly exchange sergeant handles as a way of doing their part to expose others with guns held under everyone's radar!
</li>
<li>We are <i>not</i> in any way, mean or form related to government at any level.  We are a nonprofit that simply maintains a site with minimum staffing and a dedicated cadre of volunteer collaborators.
</li>
</ul>

  <div id="Demob4" class="w3-accordion-content w3-container w3-sand">
<p>
This blog topic is titled "<strong>Is it accurate <i>enough</i>?</strong>".  Members of our site, on occasion, are contacted with their GS (Gunnery Sergeant).  If this question is posed, we can't say (accurately) if the answer is yes <i>or</i> no!
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will reinforce the appropriateness and importance of this simple question (even though the answer will perhaps be some version of <i>maybe</i>).
</p>
<p>
At the time words were crafted for the Second Amendment ("A well regulated Militia..."), muskets were the Arms <i>du jour</i>.  We'd have to speculate that the answer to this question, if posed in the late 1700's, would have been <strong>NO!</strong>
</p>
<p>
<i>No!</i> (to this blog's question) was the likely acceptable answer as evidenced by gun owners' dissatisfaction with firearms during the pre-federalist period.  Dissatisfaction spawns innovation: firearms' technology has evolved dramatically since the days of yore...
</p>
<p>
What about modern times? First: accuracy (as measured for example by hitting a target's bull's-eye predictably) seems to depend on three factors: (1) the shooter's skills, (2) the firearm being used and (3) external factors (e.g. wind, visibility of target, distance to target).
</p>
<p>
Let's start with factor #1 regarding accuracy criteria (shooter's skills).  You probably have heard of a firearm called a "Blunderbuss": Wikipedia describes it as "The blunderbuss could be considered to be an early form of shotgun, which was often adapted to military and defensive use."
Shotguns tend to forgive human ineptitude by virtue of spraying a wide range of lead shot.  The modern shotgun almost allows a "Blundering Fool" the ability to snag a covey of birds.  This wider spray, however can pose hazards (a celebrated example being Vice President Dick Cheney's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney_hunting_incident">mishap</a> in Texas).  The term "Blundering Fool" was used purposely here as the root "Blunder":   
   means "to mismanage; botch ... (...compare Old Norse blunda to close one's eyes ...) (Source: <a href="http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/blundering%20fool">English Collins Dictionary</a>).  One can almost imagine hitting a target straight on with one's eyes closed using today's weapons!
</p>
<p>
Again, to make up for substandard human skills, additional modern enhancements to firearms re-enforces casual users being able to wreak havoc after maybe a few minutes of becoming familiar with a modern day weapon such as an AR-15. 
</p>
<p>
The June 16th, 2016 editorial opinion piece that appeared in the <i>Boston Globe</i> printed two graphic images:       
       (1) A life-size entry opening measured about 1/4" in diameter.  (2) The "life-size outline of a lower leg exit wound caused by an AR-15" that measured about 6 3/4" high and 2 1/2" wide.
       The editorial goes on to state:
       "Bullets shot by assault weapons are designed to wobble upon entering the body to maximize damage.  The bullet in this case obliterated the tibia and surrounding muscles before exit."
</p>
<p>
So-called assault weapons help the gun "operator" blunder on by raking (or stitching) a line of wobbly bullets through a target.  Who cares if the first few miss the target completely?  Just one (see dimensions cited above) could be enough to cause severe damage.
</p>
<p>
Conclusion?  The human skill level "barrier" required to operate a firearm has been drastically lowered.  (The same can be said for many other modern items such as cameras).
</p>
<p>
This is why we phrase this blog's question with the adverb: <i>enough</i>.  The answer today is probably <i>yes</i>.  Most firearms seem to be accurate <i>enough</i>.
</p>
<p>
There are several powerful firearms advocate groups in the USA today.  This blog will continue with dealing with the same question: are they "accurate <i>enough</i>"?  These groups have immense clout.  Unfortunately we have observed a pattern of behavior that leads us to believe that they're all-too-often "off-target".  Here we'll cite examples where they missed the target. They're simply not accurate <i>enough</i> for our tastes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>"Target urges customers to leave guns at home"</strong> (Article page B8, 7/3/2014 <i>Boston Globe</i>).  We quote:
</p>

<div class="w3-grey">
<p>
 Target found itself drawn into the fray this spring when a Texas gun rights group posted videos online of some members openly carrying long guns in Target stores.  The photos prompted rebuke from the National Rifle Association's lobbying arm, which called the demonstrations "downright weird" in a statement on its website.  A few days later, NRA's top lobbyist backtracked on that criticism, saying it had come from an unauthorized staffer.
</p>
</div>

<p>
We feel that the NRA, in this instance, missed the target (figuratively and literally).  Are we now supposed to shop comfortably next to folks armed with AR-15s?
</p>
<p>
<strong>"Doctors should ask about guns"</strong> (Editorial, 4/3/2016 <i>Boston Globe</i>).  We quote:
</p>
<div class="w3-grey">
<p>
LONG KNOWN FOR its efforts to quash research on the dangers of guns in the home, the National Rifle Association is now attempting to intrude into the doctor's office itself...
</p>
<p>
The NRA successfully campaigned for the passage of legislation in Florida that restricts doctors from broaching the subject of gun safety.  The so-called "docs vs Glocks" law was upheld in December by a three-judge appeals panel...
</p>
</div>
<p>
Again we feel that the NRA, in this instance, missed the target.  Ironically the toddler cited in the prior blog ("Is it secure?") lives in Florida.
</p>

  </button>
  <div id="Demob5" class="w3-accordion-content w3-container w3-sand">
<p>
This blog topic is titled "<strong>Is it appropriate?</strong>".  Members of our site, on occasion, are contacted with their GS (Gunnery Sergeant).  If this question is posed, we have to presume the answer is yes!
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will reinforce the appropriateness (pun here?) and importance of this simple question.
</p>
<p>
Since it is a constitutional right to keep and bear Arms, it must be appropriate to acquire one.  So do we have to assume that 'blundering fools' (see prior blog) are Ok to have their own arms?  Do we look the other way when it would seem the NRA, for example, is 'off target' (see prior blog) at times?
</p>
<p>
What does appropriate really mean?  Revisiting the prior blog, one salient point made is that gun owners can still 'wreak havoc' with minimal human skills. This is because the weapons are so advanced they're 'accurate <i>enough</i>' for novices to operate. 
</p>
<p>
This might not sit well with some readers, but for some it would seem quite appropriate for a <i>skilled</i> marksman to bag a deer during hunting season.  The tradition of a Native Reverent American (a different sort of NRA) blessing a dead animal for giving up his spirit continues today with skilled marksmen.  One who, we would presume, not use a firearm that is simply "accurate <i>enough</i>" such as an AR-15 (that would spray multiple bullets in our forests).
</p>
<p>
<strong>"US appeals court rules lead bullets can't be regulated"</strong> (Page A9 Dec 24th 2014 <i>Boston Globe</i>).  Excerpts:
</p>
<div class="w3-grey">
<p>
At least six states have issued warnings about lead bullets and the risk for pregnant women and children.
</p>
<p>
... In 1991, the government adopted a nationwide ban on lead shot in migratory waterfowl hunting after biologists estimated 2 million ducks died each year from ingesting spent lead pellets.
</p>
</div>
<p>
It would seem inappropriate (and somewhat unsporting) to use a virtual machine gun to mow down a deer.  We would hope that organized gun enthusiasts would frown on crude, unskilled hunting. A suggested compromise: perhaps a regulation to allow it with non-leaded bullets?  (The cited article states that "there are many effective alternatives, such as substituting copper for lead bullets and lead shot."  The lawsuit that lost was brought on by "101 environmental organizations." The NRA ("and much of the pro-gun lobby") urged to uphold the dismissal.
</p>
<p>
For years there have been reasonable proposals and suggestions (e.g. limiting magazine sizes for semi-automatic weapons and the aforementioned bro-haha regarding lead and the environment).  Some strident folks still lobby for a total ban of certain categories of firearms.  This site tries to remove political stands and avoid lobbying or taking sides.  Having said that we feel that the inflexible stands that some groups take (we call it being "off target") actually may be hurting their purpose as public opinion could change. 
</p>
<p>
The Second Amendment is a national treasure.  Permitting firearms such as the AR-15s will probably continue (despite gun lobby groups that are starting to sway public opinion against them through taking 'off target' stances).  One, perhaps valid reason for keeping the status quo, is the so-called MAD culture spawned during the cold war.  MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) was a somewhat successful deterrent.  The feeling was (on both sides) that if one side launched a nuclear attack, the other would respond in equal fashion resulting in a very unfortunate state of mass destruction.  MAD applies to firearms today.  Thousands of very powerful guns exist that are certainly 'accurate <i>enough</i>' (with bullets that wobble) to create an entry hole of about five hundredths square inches, wobble, and then exit making about a thirteen square inch wound!  Insane as it sounds, if an intruder has such a weapon, then any defender would argue for the same.  MAD as it sounds, we chooses to 'nuke' one another!

This web site is trying to counter groups taking 'off target', non-compromising positions in the name of gun rights.  We don't envision ever changing the Second Amendment.  We especially don't expect much in the order of further regulations or restrictions.  We think the MAD mentality will survive even the swings of public opinion.  So how is it that we can bring value to the table?  How can we make the world loaded with the gun-MAD culture a safer world?  Read on.

We quote directly from an Op Ed by Farah Pandith (<i>Boston Globe</i> Dec. 17th, 2015): "Recruitment depends on one-to-one engagement.  For this reason, inoculation of millennials against extremism must begin at the local level, outside of government."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pandith was writing about the relative ease ISIS has in getting younger folks attention (often via social media).  His suggestion is to combat the ISIS strategy using the technique we quote - of importance to our site's parallel focus are his words: <i>outside of government</i>.  Before explaining this he describes a "digital army" using a mellennial's words:
</p>
<div class="w3-grey">
<p>
She said, "If you want this generation to understand what you really mean, we have to build Dumbledore's Army."
</p>
<p>
Even with his formidable magic powers, Harry Potter still needed an army. And so do we.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Our web site is becoming a digital army.  We aim to thwart would-be-terrorists, gang punks, and other malcontents that possess guns and are dangerous.  Our techniques are varied and many.  There are too many to enumerate here.  We collaborate with other web sites such as <a href="https://nra.collogistics.com:3448/">NRA.rip</a> whose purpose is to introduce our "We Do Our Part" <i>army</i> as well as to invite folks to our parlor presentations (Mr. Pandith's "local level" approach).
</p>
<p>
Some attributes of our workings are described in the FAQs.  Here we present a sample mechanism used to collect illegal firearms.
</p>
<p>
We have numerous (but behind-the-scenes) heuristics that help us make decisions.  Our sponsor role (see FAQs) is background checked in order to block folks with, for example, criminal records.  We are building a reliable database of gun manufacturers and especially makes, models and serial numbers of guns produced.  If someone tries to claim they have a gun with a serial number that matches someone else's we know immediately.  If someone has a gun with a missing serial number (perhaps filed off illegally) we work with them to handle that case.  Possibly we would swap the same make/model and get the unidentifiable gun off the streets.  There are many possibilities.
</p>
<p>
In summary, our approach, if anything, is to emulate the NRA and other groups.  By this we mean we hold reverent the Second Amendment, but we hope to remain on target and focused. By promoting our "groundswell managed militia" we hope to make the MAD world safer!
