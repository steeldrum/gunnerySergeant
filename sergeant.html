    <p>We solicit volunteer Gunnery Sergeants!</p>

  <p>Understand the role a Gunnery Sergeant (GS) plays. If the application is approved then details will be emailed to the Gunnery Sergeant collaborator.  However a summary is here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The GS is expected to be accredited by the Gunnery Sergeant Organization.</li>
  <li>The GS undergoes web-based online training.</li>
  <li>The GS commits to try to contact his or her platoon at regular intervals and logs relevant details.</li>
  <li>The GS indirectly contacts a gun owner sponsor (in lieu of the owner) when the owner is an uncertified private.</li>
  <li>The GS never solicits any personal information about the owner (and the system hides this information if available).  This means that the contact is addressed solely by his or her's handle.</li>
  <li>The GS is provided with a trigger method to reach the sponsor (never knowing that person's first name etc.). The GS does know the gun owner's handle. This type of communication is done when (and if) the gun owner is an uncertified private (or failure exists in communications).</li>
  <li>The GS never voices concerns about the gun owner to this organization.  If concerns arise the gun owner and/or sponsor is informed (the latter indirectly via the trigger mechanism).</li>
</ul>

<p>We assume that prospective GS's (aka Gunnery Sergeants) have already enlisted as booster member collaborators.  If you haven't (as yet) enlisted please do so here: <a class="w3-btn w3-round-large" href="javascript:processBoosterCollaboratorEnlistment();">Enlist as a Collaborator!</a> and then return to apply.</p>

   <p>Once the organization acknowledges you as a booster collaborator, you may make a formal request to help by becoming a GS.</p>

<p>To formally apply please do so here:</p>
